# Getting the app to run

Both the backend and the frontend need to be started separately
This can be done in two separate terminals

## Starting the app

In the backend and fronted directories respectively:

### `npm start`

Runs the respective apps on the local servers
Running on the backend will show `Server is running on port "your given port"` in the terminal once the server is running
